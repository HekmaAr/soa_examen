The Employee Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline and enhance the management of employee-related tasks within an organization. This system utilizes a modern and efficient technology stack, including Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and MySQL for the database.

**Technology Stack:**

*Backend:*
- **Spring Boot:** The backend of the Employee Management System is built using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework known for its simplicity and ease of use. Spring Boot provides a robust and scalable foundation for developing enterprise-level applications.

- **MySQL:** The database layer is powered by MySQL, a reliable relational database management system. MySQL is utilized for storing and retrieving employee-related data, ensuring data integrity and efficiency in data management.

*Frontend:*
- **Angular:** The frontend of the application is developed using Angular, a powerful and dynamic front-end framework. Angular facilitates the creation of a responsive and interactive user interface, enabling seamless communication with the backend.

**Backend Technology:**

The backend, powered by Spring Boot, handles data processing, business logic, and database interactions. It exposes RESTful APIs that the frontend consumes for seamless communication. Spring Boot's modular and organized structure simplifies code maintenance and promotes scalability.

**Frontend Technology:**

Angular, on the frontend, provides a dynamic and responsive user interface. It facilitates the creation of modular components and services, enhancing code maintainability and reusability. Angular's two-way data binding ensures real-time updates between the user interface and backend data.

In conclusion, the Employee Management System offers a robust solution for organizations to efficiently manage their workforce. The use of Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL ensures a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for handling various employee-related tasks.
